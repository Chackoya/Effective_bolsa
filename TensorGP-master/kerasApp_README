Some runs with different configs are in the outputfolder... used 20 to 500 generations to try stuff...


Dependencies are the same as the normal version of those files ( except that im using the new keras/tf versions but it shouldn't impact here)


Usage kerasApp example:

- choose one of the weights mobile / xception and change line ~110 to your path
- change line 49 - 50 by uncommenting the useless line (depending if using xception or mobilenet)
- run it
